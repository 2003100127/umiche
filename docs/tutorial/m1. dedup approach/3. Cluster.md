# Connected components

:material-standard-definition: **Connected components** are a key concept in graph theory, a field within mathematics and computer science that explores the properties of graphs. A graph is made up of vertices (or nodes) and edges that link pairs of vertices. In an undirected graph, a connected component is defined as a maximal subgraph where each pair of vertices is connected by a path. This means that within a connected component, any vertex can be reached from any other vertex through some path, and there are no additional vertices in the overall graph that can be included in this component without losing this property.


:simple-thealgorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is an effective algorithm for finding connected components in an undirected graph. It starts from a given node, explores all its neighbors, then proceeds to explore the neighbors' neighbors, and so on. A queue is used to manage the vertices that need to be explored next. To identify all connected components using BFS, follow these steps:

!!! tip

    :material-ray-start: **Initialization**

    * Visited List/Set: Maintain a list or set to track which vertices have been visited.

    * Component List: Initialize a list or counter to store the connected components found.

    :octicons-iterations-16: **Iteration Over All Vertices**

    For each vertex in the graph, check if it has already been visited.
    If it hasn't been visited, it marks the beginning of a new connected component.

    :material-keyboard-return: **BFS Traversal**

    * Start a BFS from this unvisited vertex.
    * Use a queue to manage the exploration process. Enqueue the starting vertex and mark it as visited.
    * While the queue is not empty:
    * Dequeue a vertex.
    * For each of its neighbors, if they have not been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue them.
    * All vertices visited during this BFS are part of the current connected component.

    :material-repeat: **Repeated operation**

    Repeat the process for every unvisited vertex, thereby identifying new connected components.

    :material-note-multiple-outline: **Output**

    A list of connected components, with each component consisting of a set of vertices that are interconnected.


# Programming BFS algorithm

We programmed a Python function for breadth-First Search for connected components in a UMI graph with two methods, `deque` and `set`.

    'D': ['A', 'E', 'F'],
    'E': ['D', 'G'],
    'F': ['D', 'G'],
    'G': ['E', 'F'],
}

connected_components = uc.graph.cc(
    graph_adj=graph_adj_mclumi,
    method='deque',
    verbose=True

# `Cluster` for UMI deduplication

There are two methods to get the connected components from a UMI graph, a `deque` method based on our customised code and a `networkx` method using `NetworkX` (installed via `pip install pip install networkx`). The number of connected components are reported as the `Cluster` method in UMI-tools[^1].

:star: The `deque` method.

:material-language-python: `Python`
``` py linenums="1"
import umiche as uc

cc_cluster = uc.dedup.cluster(
    graph=graph_adj_mclumi,
    method='deque',
)
print(cc_cluster)
```

:material-console: `console`
``` shell
{0: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G']}
```

!!! success "Deduplicated UMI count"

    There is only one cluster 0, and therefore, the deduplicated count of UMIs from 7 unique UMIs is **1** at the single locus.

:material-arrow-right-top: The `deque` function

:material-language-python: `Python`
``` py linenums="1"
def cc(
        graph_adj,
):
    connected_components = list(gbfscc().deque(graph_adj))
    return {i: cc for i, cc in enumerate(connected_components)}
```


:star: The `networkx` method. This method requires a graph as input represented by an edge list.

:material-language-python: `Python`
``` py linenums="1"
import umiche as uc

adj = uc.graph.adjacency(
    graph_adj=graph_adj_mclumi,
)

cc_cluster = uc.dedup.cluster(
    graph=adj.to_edge_list(rr=True),
    method='networkx',
)
print(cc_cluster)
```

:material-console: `console`
``` shell
{0: NodeView(('B', 'A', 'D', 'C', 'F', 'G', 'E'))}
```


:material-arrow-right-top: The `networkx` function

:material-language-python: `Python`
``` py linenums="1"
def ccnx(
        edge_list,
):
    import networkx as nx
    G = nx.Graph()
    for edge in edge_list:
        G.add_edge(edge[0], edge[1])
    return {i: G.subgraph(cc).nodes() for i, cc in enumerate(nx.connected_components(G))}
