The UMI count deduplicated by the `Unique` method is interpreted as the number of unique UMIs observed at a single locus. Thus, consider there is a UMI graph containing non-repeated UMI nodes of 7.

``` py
graph_adj_mclumi = {
    'A': ['B', 'C', 'D'],
    'B': ['A', 'C'],
    'C': ['A', 'B'],
    'D': ['A', 'E', 'F'],
    'E': ['D', 'G'],
    'F': ['D', 'G'],
    'G': ['E', 'F'],
}
```

!!! success "Deduplicated UMI count"

    There are 7 nodes, and therefore, the deduplicated count of UMIs from 7 unique UMIs is **7** at the single locus.
